\arguments{
\item{data.obj}{A list object in a format specific to MicrobiomeStat, which can include components such as feature.tab (matrix), feature.ann (matrix), meta.dat (data.frame), tree, and feature.agg.list (list). The data.obj can be converted from other formats using several functions from the MicrobiomeStat package, including: 'mStat_convert_DGEList_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_DESeqDataSet_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_phyloseq_to_data_obj', 'mStat_convert_SummarizedExperiment_to_data_obj', 'mStat_import_qiime2_as_data_obj', 'mStat_import_mothur_as_data_obj', 'mStat_import_dada2_as_data_obj', and 'mStat_import_biom_as_data_obj'. Alternatively, users can construct their own data.obj. Note that not all components of data.obj may be required for all functions in the MicrobiomeStat package.}

\item{subject.var}{A character string that indicates the column name in the metadata which uniquely identifies each subject or sample.}

\item{time.var}{A character string representing the time variable column in the metadata. Time points should be numeric. If not, the function will convert it to numeric. Default is NULL.}

\item{group.var}{A character string specifying the grouping variable column in the metadata. This variable differentiates between different experimental or observational groups.}

\item{adj.vars}{A vector of character strings. Each string should denote a column name in the metadata that will serve as a covariate in the analysis. These variables might account for potential confounding influences. Default is NULL.}

\item{feature.level}{A character string indicating the taxonomic resolution for analysis (e.g., "Phylum", "Class"). This choice will determine the granularity of the analysis.}

\item{prev.filter}{Numeric value specifying the minimum prevalence threshold for filtering
taxa before analysis. Taxa with prevalence below this value will be removed.
Prevalence is calculated as the proportion of samples where the taxon is present.
Default 0 removes no taxa by prevalence filtering.}

\item{abund.filter}{Numeric value specifying the minimum abundance threshold for filtering
taxa before analysis. Taxa with mean abundance below this value will be removed.
Abundance refers to counts or proportions depending on \code{feature.dat.type}.
Default 0 removes no taxa by abundance filtering.}

\item{feature.dat.type}{A character string, either "count" or "proportion", indicating the nature of the data in the `data.obj`. This helps the function to determine if normalization is required. Default is "count".}

\item{feature.sig.level}{A numeric threshold, usually between 0 and 1, for assessing the significance of individual taxa. Default is 0.1.}

\item{feature.mt.method}{A character string specifying the method employed for multiple testing correction (e.g., "fdr" for False Discovery Rate). Default is "fdr".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to cater to any specialized requirements. For now, these are placeholder and not used.}
}
\value{
A list of dataframes, with each dataframe representing a specific taxonomic level (as specified in `feature.level`). These dataframes contain essential statistics, including taxa changes, p-values, and other metrics derived from the linear model.
}
\description{
This function is designed to conduct a longitudinal trend test on microbiome data. The primary aim is to discern how the abundance of various microbial taxa changes over time and/or in response to different experimental or observational groups. The function delivers robust statistical insights that enable researchers to draw meaningful conclusions about the dynamics of microbial populations.
}
\details{
The function progresses through several steps:
1. Input Validation: Checks the integrity of the `data.obj`.
2. Data Normalization: If the `feature.dat.type` is "count", the function applies normalization to make the data suitable for downstream analyses.
3. Taxa Filtration: The taxa are filtered based on the specified prevalence and abundance filters.
4. Trend Test Calculation: The function leverages the "linda" method to perform the trend tests for each specified taxonomic level.
5. Results Compilation: All the results are collated and returned as a list of data frames.

Specific interactions between `group.var` and `time.var` can be inspected if `group.var` is not NULL. This helps in understanding if microbial trends vary between groups over time.

If `group.var` is NULL, the function focuses solely on the influence of time.
