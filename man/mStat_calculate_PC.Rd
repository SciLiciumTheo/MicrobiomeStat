\title{Calculate Principal Coordinates using MDS, NMDS}
\usage{
mStat_calculate_PC(dist.obj, method = c("mds"), k = 2, dist.name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dist.obj}{A list containing distance matrices for each beta diversity
metric (e.g., Bray-Curtis). The matrices should be named with the metric's
abbreviation.}

\item{method}{A character vector specifying which methods to use for
calculating PCoA. Supported methods are "mds" (MDS), "nmds" (NMDS)}

\item{k}{An integer specifying the number of principal coordinates to retain.
Default is 2.}

\item{dist.name}{A character vector specifying which beta diversity indices to calculate. Supported indices are "BC" (Bray-Curtis), "Jaccard", "UniFrac" (unweighted UniFrac), "GUniFrac" (generalized UniFrac), "WUniFrac" (weighted UniFrac), and "JS" (Jensen-Shannon divergence). If a name is provided but the corresponding object does not exist within dist.obj, it will be computed internally. If the specific index is not supported, an error message will be returned.
to be used from the dist.obj list. Default is 'BC'.}
}
\value{
A list containing the PCoA results for each specified method and
  distance matrix. The results are named with the method's abbreviation.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Principal Coordinates based on
different methods such as Metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS),
Non-Metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS)
}
\examples{

library(vegan)
data(peerj32.obj)
dist.obj <- mStat_calculate_beta_diversity(peerj32.obj, dist.name = c('BC', 'Jaccard'))

pc.obj <- mStat_calculate_PC(dist.obj, method = c('mds'), k = 2, dist.name = c('BC','Jaccard'))
