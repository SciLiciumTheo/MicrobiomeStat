The `MicrobiomeStat` package is a state-of-the-art R tool with a **special focus on the analysis of longitudinal microbiome data**. While capable of handling multi-omics data and cross-sectional studies, its **core strength lies in its proficiency in longitudinal analysis**. This makes it an invaluable resource for researchers conducting extensive biological studies over time.

## Important Note on CRAN Version {#cran-version-note}

Due to the **ongoing development cycle**, the **most up-to-date features** of `MicrobiomeStat` have **not yet been uploaded to the CRAN repository**. The current CRAN version **only supports the `linda` and `linda.plot` functions**. If you **require additional functionalities**, particularly for **analyzing longitudinal data**, we recommend **installing the development version from GitHub**. To do this, you'll first need to **install the `devtools` package** if you haven't already:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

Once `devtools` is installed, you can install `MicrobiomeStat` from GitHub using the following command:

```R
devtools::install_github("cafferychen777/MicrobiomeStat")
```
